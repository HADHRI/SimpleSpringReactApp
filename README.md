# SimpleSpringReactApp

A simple spring Boot and React application in order to develop a CRUD with spring back-end and to get famailiar with reactjs ( NavBar , Router ,Table,ReactBootstrap)
as my first experience with this framework.

This project doesn't handle administrator part and Spring-security . Still a lot of functionnality to add
